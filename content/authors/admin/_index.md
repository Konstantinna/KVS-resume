Konstantina has worked in media and data analytics since 2012, initially working mostly with AI-enabled industry tools for consumer intellingence, topic and sentiment analysis like Brandwatch & Synthesio. Going "back to school" for a degree in Cognitive Science, she realised she wanted to deepen her understanding and skills in statistics, data analysis and visualisation with R & Python.

Her interest in media literacy & combating misinformation make her a contributor to the Association of European Journalists educational series "Chronicles of the Infodemic" and a correspondent for children's news media (focusing on science & society).
